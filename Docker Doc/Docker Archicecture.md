## VM

1.  We can install different os on hypervisor then we can run different app

2. Then we can host our application on top of each guest OS.

## Docker
1. If host is linux based then docker will be linux based, if host will be macOS then docker will be mac os based.
2. all of the apps will be run as docker container.
