## Some questions
1. what is docker volumes?
ans: Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by docker containers. 
2. Use of docker volumes
   used to keep seperated container from storage. so that if i delete container it does not hampare storage. 
   uesd to share volumes or data among different containers. 
   used to attached volume to container.

## command
1. create volums
```
docker volume create vol_name
```
2. show all volume
```
docker volume ls
```
3. display details info
```
docker volume inspect vol_name
```
4. Remove docker volume 
```
docker volume rm vol_name
```
5. Remove all unused volume 
```
docker volume prune
```

### volume share between container to container with jenkins example

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language.

1. run jenkins
``` 
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins
```
first 8080 is local server : second 8080 is  local server port. this is jenkin serverport  50000:50000 I dont know

2. run denkins with name and attacing custom volume
```
docker run --name container_custom_Name -v volume_location_and_name:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins
```

3. Run another jenkins container
```
docker run --name container_custom_Name_2 -v volume_location_and_name:/var/jenkins_home -p 9191:8080 -p 60000:50000 jenkins/jenkins
```
### volume sharing between host machine and container (bind mount) this command is not workign.
bind mount means instead of useing volume we used physical location instead of location

```
docker run --name container_custom_Name_2 -v volume_location_and_name(i.e. /Users/Mehedi/Desktop/jenkin_vol):/var/jenkins_home -p 9393:8080 -p 60008:50000 jenkins/jenkins
```
note: here jenkin_vol shold not created before in Desktoop.
