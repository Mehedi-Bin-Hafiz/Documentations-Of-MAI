## Some Questions
What is docker Compose?
ans: Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command.
It allows to deploy, combine, and configure multiple docker containers at the same time. 

1. check docker-compose version
```
docker-compose -version
```
2. Create docker compose
The name of the file must be
```
docker-compose.yml
```
3. This file must start with version
[form this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/) we can map which compose  version support which docker  version.
