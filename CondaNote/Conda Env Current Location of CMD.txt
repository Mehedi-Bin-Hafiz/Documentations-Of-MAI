create a Conda environment directly in the directory where you open the command prompt or terminal, you can use the --prefix flag with . (dot), which represents the current directory.
Steps:

    Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to your desired directory (if not already there).

    Run the following command:

    conda create --prefix ./env_name python=3.x

    Replace env_name with the desired name for your environment and 3.x with the Python version you want.

Example:

If you are in the directory C:\myproject and want to create an environment named venv, use:

conda create --prefix ./venv python=3.8

This will create the environment in C:\myproject\venv.
Activating the Environment:

To activate the environment, use:

conda activate ./venv

Deactivating the Environment:

To deactivate, use:

conda deactivate

Notes:

    The environment will be created in the current working directory under the folder you specify (e.g., ./venv).
    The --prefix option ensures the environment is created in the specified path, regardless of the default Conda environment location.
